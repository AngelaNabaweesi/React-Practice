        <div className="div2">
          <div className="h1heading">VERSE 1</div>
          <p>God of creation<br/>
          There at the start<br/>
          Before the beginning of time<br/>
          With no point of reference<br/>
          You spoke to the dark<br/>
          And fleshed out the wonder of light</p><br />
  
          <div className="h1heading">CHORUS 1</div>
          <p>And as You speak<br/>
          A hundred billion galaxies are born<br/>
          In the vapour of Your breath the planets form<br/>
          If the stars were made to worship so will I<br/>
          I can see Your heart in everything You’ve made<br/>
          Every burning star<br/>
          A signal fire of grace<br/>
          If creation sings Your praises so will I</p><br/>
  
          <div className="h1heading">VERSE 2</div>
          <p>God of Your promise<br/>
          You don’t speak in vain<br/>
          No syllable empty or void<br/>
          For once You have spoken<br/>
          All nature and science<br/>
          Follow the sound of Your voice</p><br/>
  
          <div className="h1heading">CHORUS</div>
          <p>And as You speak<br/>
          A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath<br/>
          Evolving in pursuit of what You said<br/>
          If it all reveals Your nature so will I<br/>
          I can see Your heart in everything You say<br/>
          Every painted sky<br/>
          A canvas of Your grace<br/>
          If creation still obeys You so will I</p><br/>
  
          <div className="h1heading">BRIDGE</div>
          <p >If the stars were made to worship so will I<br/>
          If the mountains bow in reverence so will I<br/>
          If the oceans roar Your greatness so will I<br/>
          For if everything exists to lift You high so will I<br/>
          If the wind goes where You send it so will I<br/>
          If the rocks cry out in silence so will I<br/>
          If the sum of all our praises still falls shy<br/>
          Then we’ll sing again a hundred billion times</p><br/>
  
          <div className="h1heading">VERSE 3</div>
          <p>God of salvation<br/>
          You chased down my heart<br/>
          Through all of my failure and pride<br/>
          On a hill You created<br/>
          The light of the world<br/>
          Abandoned in darkness to die</p><br/>
  
          <div className="h1heading">CHORUS 3</div>
          <p>And as You speak<br/>
          A hundred billion failures disappear<br/>
          Where You lost Your life so I could find it here<br/>
          If You left the grave behind You so will I<br/>
          I can see Your heart in everything You’ve done<br/>
          Every part designed in a work of art called love<br/>
          If You gladly chose surrender so will I<br/>
          I can see Your heart<br/>
          Eight billion different ways<br/>
          Every precious one<br/>
          A child You died to save<br/>
          If You gave Your life to love them so will I</p><br/>
  
          <div className="h1heading">TAG</div>
          <p>Like You would again a hundred billion times<br/>
          But what measure could amount to Your desire<br/>
          You’re the One who never leaves the one behind</p>
        </div>
      </div>
